This week I wasn't able to work on much - however I was able to get something to work on: creating a script that allows users to click a button and a random object will appear on the table of the VR world - this is mainly used to test configurations between systems. 

While I have begun making the script - I have not gotten very far due to an out of bounds indexing error I keep getting with the current Unity scene I am working in. The error has persisted all week and deleting the UR5 robot arm does not help the issue so I am a little at a loss. 

Currently, I feel like I have not been able to make any meaningful contributions to this this project, and I really do feel like I can do more which is why I am hoping to finish the current script noted above early next week so I can work on something more useful to this project.
