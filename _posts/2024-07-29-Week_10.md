This week I was able to really focus on benchmarking and fine-tuning my scripts and scenes from prior weeks.

In terms of benchmarking, Lily - a fellow iCAN student - and I focused on creating the benchmark for Box Folding which ran using OBPRM (Obstacle Based Probabilistic Road Map). We found that it was the best and quickest way to solve the benchmark. Because this benchmark is considered a narrow passage benchmark - OBPRM is the best planner for it.

I also decided to try and solve Bug Trap - which ended up being harder than I thought it would be. I attempted to use TogglePRM for this benchmark as it has certain advantages in this kind of scenario as compared to OBPRM. Because we are attempting to map narrow spaces between a 'bug trap' and the 'stick bug' robot - TogglePRM is a better approach as compared to OBPRM. Based on my understanding in this kind of problem it would be helpful to compute the free space and obstacle space for such a tight/narrow benchmark. 

Overall, it has been a great summer and I found that I have learned a lot as well as learned some things in Unity which has been a blast to use! I even picked up a little bit of C# along the way which I am sure will be quite useful. I really enjoyed my time at Parasol - from learning some of what the lab does and getting to work with XR components - each part has left quite the impression on me and I am really thankful for this opportunity.
