This week I have been assigned creating background scenes to make a user feel like they are in a room. This will be useful for user studies which the robot can later learn from.

Similar to the object spawner script last week, each time a user clicks a button - this time button R on a keyboard - the room's scene/environment changes. The UR5e robot is still displayed in the middle of the scene typically on a table in the middle of the room, but all other elements have been modified. The room backgrounds I have developed here are a kitchen, living room, and office. 

Almost all elements in the scene are modified and are made to feel like the room has been completely modified. Here I also pulled down nicer looking pre-fabs from the Unity asset store which helped make the rooms look more life-like.
