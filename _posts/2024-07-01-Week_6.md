This week I geared up to begin my very first work in Unity without a tutorial - creating an object spawn script that the UR5e robot could interact with later on!

The goal here is to swap an object onto our VR table upon the click of a button on the Oculus controller or in my case on my keyboard. The script allows users to spawn in a regular glass cup, a game controller, and a laptop.

I found lots of excellent free assets on Unity's asset store, pulled in the necessary objects and created a C# script that interacts with the scene which was created by one of my fellow summer students Grace. 

The script works when a user clicks the spacebar on the keyboard and each click spawns a new object from the list. Once a user clicks the button 3 times the script clears all objects.
