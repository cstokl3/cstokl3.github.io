This week is the first week I was able to begin working on my actual summer project!

I have found out my mentors will be Courtney and Isaac - and the project will be related to Interactive Planning specifically focused on working in VR. 

I have been paired up with Grace - another summer student. The goal for this week and early next week is to finally figure out inverse kinematics. I have begun working off my own robot arm in Unity and have begun working through some great tutorials Courtney has sent me about how ROS and Unity connect, as well as a FastIK package to help with correcting the current inverse kinematics on the arm in VR specifically. 

I will be reaching out to my mentors about gaining some new perspective on any other smaller projects to work on in the scope of interactive planning.
