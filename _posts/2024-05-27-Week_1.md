This week I was able to get acquianted with the lab, meet everyone, and listed in on presentations from senior members of the lab. 

I also began the parasol lab crash course where I first learned about what the lab is about, and began the first round of content - ROS. Because I am on a Macbook running silicon,I was unable to use the Docker container provided in the crash course, and instead need to remote into a lab computer in order to be able to work on anything. 

Courtney was able to help me with this step and I was successfully able to complete my initial set up.
