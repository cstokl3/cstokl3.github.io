This week I was able to complete the Unity Tutorials - Rollaball and MetaVR, as well as the AI-crash-course (discrete-search, multi-agent search, and continuous search).

It has been very interesting finishing out Amnon's discrete search crash course - especially since it has so much relevance in working in robotics and how things move. Different angles and fields of motion also are important to note here.
