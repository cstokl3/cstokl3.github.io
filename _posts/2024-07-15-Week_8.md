This week I have been focused on implementing three different types of grippers for the UR5e robot. Courtney sent me the urdf files for each robotiq gripper and I was able to implement them into the Unity scene.

Each gripper came as a prefab and articulation bodies. For this week I implemented a C# script again similar to both the room and object swapper scripts from the two prior weeks and attached each gripper to the end effector of the robot. The gripper swapper does the same thing as both scripts which means it swaps between each gripper upon the click of the button G on the keyboard. 

Apart from the work on the robot I began working on my 'poster' - which is currently present on the 'Project' tab of this website. I currently have implemented an outline and will continue to fill it in as I continue.
