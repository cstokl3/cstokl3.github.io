This week we learned about Unity!

I started on the Rollaball tutorial provided, and added myself to the lab website as an iCAN student. I also made lots of headway on my personal website/blog. 

During the crash course there were lots of examples of using VR, and because I have a PS5 VR headset that is compatable with Unity I will be able to test things using it once things are built. 

Unity's physics and tutorials made thing very smooth and I was able to really understand the basics of everything and get comfortable with this bit of technology and it opened a new avenue I'd like to focus on in the future. 

I am very excited to begin working on something tangible and really see what building something looks like.
