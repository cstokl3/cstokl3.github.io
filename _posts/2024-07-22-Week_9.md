This week was a lot of fine-tuning my scripts, setting my gripper articulation joints to work with the URDF processor script to actually be able to move the fingers of the gripper - this part is still a little bit wonky but I will continue to work on it! I also fixed up a lot of the materials on the pre-fabs and started to make everything look nicer.

I continued on with my poster page on this site and have fleshed out my outline a bit more. I'm hoping to add a few more pictures/gifs of all the different things I've worked on this semester to really make it pop. 

I also started to install all of the items needed to work on benchmarking. Because I am on Mac, unfortunatly Docker does not work for me so I did need to install FastX, and remote into one of the lab computers called baretta.
