My name is Caroline Stoklosinski. 

I am a current iCAN student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I graduated with my Bachelors in Information science in 2023, and have since been working my way towards learning computer science. My summer research will be spent at the Parasol Lab, under Dr. Amato's mentorship, where I will working on a project in robot task and motion planning. My current hobbies include traveling, knitting, and creating new programming projects!
